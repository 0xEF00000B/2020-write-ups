# ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰ (Zoop)

With this challenge we had to pwn `http://zoop.wpictf.xyz/`. This URL showed a simple text file sharing site.
This looked a bit like it was an internal company site, but that aside. You could attach a file to a message to send via the UI.
This included a preview button, where you could preview said file. Either way it wasn't hard to guess which file it was.
This because the textbox showed the text `http://storage.zoop/some_file.txt` as replacement for actual input.

Entering `http://storage.zoop/flag.txt` and hitting preview gave the flag: `WPI{tH4nKs_z00m3r_jh0n50n}`


Entering this flag gave us **50** points. Bringing our total points to **51**
