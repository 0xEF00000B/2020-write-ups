This was quite an interesting one. Not knowing anything, we ultimately found it after reading hints at the Discord and using
 our own knowledge to solve it further. 
 
 The flag was in the standard format.
 
 After browsing the site for hours and looking at the Discord, we found ultimately a team name.
 
 This team had as only member the user `admin` which didn't exist. Thus we had the flag.
 
 The flag was: `WPI{the_best_teams_make_the_flags}`
 
 This gave us **50** points bringing our total to **476** points.
