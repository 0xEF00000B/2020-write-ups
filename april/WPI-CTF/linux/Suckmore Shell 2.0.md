# Suckmore Shell 2.0

This was a nice one. We immediately got this one.

We had to connect using `ssh smsh@smsh.wpictf.xyz` with the password: `suckmore>suckless`.

Then we used `ls` on the basic terminal, which gave us a file named `flag`

Due to the title, we thought "looks like we got to use `more`".

Using said command as `more flag` we got the flag.

The flag was `WPI{SUckmoreSoftwareN33dz2G3TitTogeTHER}`.

This gave us **200** points, bringing our total to **376** points.
